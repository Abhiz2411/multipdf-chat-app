# 📚 MultiPDF Chat App

Interact with multiple PDF documents using natural language queries powered by AI.

## 🔍 Overview

The **MultiPDF Chat App** is a user-friendly application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload and query multiple PDFs simultaneously. Leveraging advanced language models and vector search, it provides intelligent, context-aware responses based on your documents.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **PDF Loading**: Extracts text from all uploaded PDF pages.
2. **Text Chunking**: Breaks down large text into manageable chunks.
3. **Embedding**: Converts chunks into semantic vector representations.
4. **Similarity Matching**: Finds most relevant chunks for your query.
5. **Chat Generation**: Uses a language model to generate answers based on matched content.
